This document defines the encoding rules for the WebTLV framework, a set of specifications for deeply embedded web applications based on the ASN.1 family of data structure and encoding standards by ITU and ISO.

The encodings defined are a mapping of common web content types such as XML and CSS to ASN.1 data structures, designed for efficient encoding, transmission and processing on computer systems with constrained resources.

Applications
------------

* deeply embedded web services
* physical internet of things
* smart card interaction
* near-field communications

Audience
--------

* WebTLV implementors
* WebTLV developers
* smart card community
* web standards community

Contents
--------

* discussion of design objectives
* definition of encoding compatibility
* definition of WebTLV encoding rules
* definition of WebTLV content formats
